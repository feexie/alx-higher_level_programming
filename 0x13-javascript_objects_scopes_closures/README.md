# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures Project

## Project Description

This JavaScript project is centered around mastering essential concepts: objects, scopes, and closures. It comprises a series of progressively challenging tasks designed to deepen your understanding of JavaScript programming.

## Learning Objectives

- **Object Creation**: Learn how to create and manipulate JavaScript objects using the class notation.
- **Variable Types and Scope**: Understand the significance of variable types and scope in JavaScript, emphasizing the importance of proper variable declaration and usage.
- **Closures and Prototypes**: Explore the powerful concepts of closures and prototypes in JavaScript, understanding how they contribute to the language's flexibility.
- **Inheritance**: Implement inheritance between objects, gaining insights into creating reusable and extensible code structures.
- **Error Handling and Validation**: Develop robust error-handling skills and perform input validation to enhance the reliability of your code.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into multiple tasks, each addressing a specific aspect of JavaScript. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Task 0 - Rectangle #0**: Introduction to class notation and object creation.
2. **Task 1 - Rectangle #1**: Creating a class with a constructor and initializing instance attributes.
3. **Task 2 - Rectangle #2**: Adding validation to the constructor, creating an empty object for certain conditions.
4. **Task 3 - Rectangle #3**: Introducing instance methods, starting with a `print` method.
5. **Task 4 - Rectangle #4**: Extending the class with additional instance methods - `rotate` and `double`.
6. **Task 5 - Square #0**: Implementing class inheritance, creating a Square class that inherits from Rectangle.
7. **Task 6 - Square #1**: Further extending the Square class with a customizable `charPrint` method.
8. **Task 7 - Occurrences**: Writing a function to count the occurrences of a specified element in a list.
9. **Task 8 - Esrever**: Implementing a function to reverse the order of elements in a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.
10. **Task 9 - Log Me**: Creating a function to log the number of arguments printed and their values.
11. **Task 10 - Number Conversion**: Writing a function to convert a number from base 10 to another base.

## Getting Started
